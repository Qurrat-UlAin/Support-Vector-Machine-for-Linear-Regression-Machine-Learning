###Details:###
*Notebook1: simple data anlaysis 
*Notebook2: partitioning of data, we identified our target varaible which we have to predict. we create a sliding window, using min max scalre we created our matrices. we also have identified the fact that we'll be using 4 columns to rpedict one column (from the shape)
*Notebook3: linear kernel has only two parameters to be optimized: C and epsilon 
*Notebook4: Polynomial kernel has three parameters to be optimized: C and epsilon and degree
*Notebook5: Rdial Basis Kernel kernel has three parameters to be optimized: C and epsilon and gamma
